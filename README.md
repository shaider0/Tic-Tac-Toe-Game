Welcome to tic-tac-toe, my first deployed application as a software engineer! This README will walk you through my development process & how the application works. Hope you enjoy :-)

Development Process:

- [X]Review requirements documentation for big picture as well as detailed expectations for the project
- [X]Brainstorm and diagram out some of the core functions of the application and start thinking about how you will approach it.
- [X]Write out user stories and build a wireframe
- [X]Build the game board (HTML & CSS)
- [X]Get clicks to represent X's and O's on the board (jQuery)
- [X]Write the game logic (JavaScript conditional statements to check for the various possible winning scenarios and tie scenarios)
- [X]Interact with the API to create a game, update an array representing the various board positions with each click, and retrieve total games played. Also interact with the API to allow users to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. (AJAX, read API documentation)
- [X]Look for opportunities to make code DRY
- [X]Add basic styles
- [X]Work on stretch goals (time permitting)

  User Stories

  * First time users will want to create an account so they can access the game and keep track of their statistics
  * Returning users will want to log in so they can play the game
  * During gameplay, users will want to see whose turn it is
  * During gameplay, users will want the board to display their clicks as either Xs or Os
  * Users will want to have the ability to start a new game at any point without refreshing the page
  * Users will want to be able to log out at any time
